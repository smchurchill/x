# 3-manifolds algorithmically bound 4-manifolds
There are two major components to this project: design of the algorithm and implementation of the algorithm.

Algorithm design is complete, pending revisions to my M.Sc thesis.

Implementation will be as a module for Regina: Software for 3-Manifold Topology.  Ideally, this would be done in partial fulfillment of a PhD research project.

# Abstract

> This thesis presents an algorithm for producing 4–manifold triangulations with boundary an arbitrary orientable, closed, triangulated 3–manifold.
> The research is an extension of Costantino and Thurston’s work on determining upper bounds on the number of 4–dimensional simplices necessary to construct such a triangulation.
> Our first step in this bordism construction is the geometric partitioning of an initial 3–manifold M using smooth singularity theory.
> This partition provides handle attachment sites on the 4–manifold Mx[0,1] and the ensuing handle attachments eliminate one of the boundary components of Mx[0,1], yielding a 4-manifold with boundary exactly M.
> We first present the construction in the smooth case before extending the smooth singularity theory to triangulated 3–manifolds.
