I think that I understand the text at the start of Section 3.4.1, but I don’t really see how Figure 3.11 illustrates the text.  Can you explain?

pp. 20 & 22:  Wording format should be symmetric 

The description of Figure 3.7 on p. 20 is in paragraph format, but the description of Figure 3.10 on p. 22 is in list format.  They should be the same format—I think that the list format is better.

p 25:  Definitions of primed edge block and primed vertex block

I suggest that the start of the definition for Primed edge block be “A primed edge block E’ is identical to…” and similarly for the Primed vertex block:  “A primed vertex block V’ is identical to…”

p. 25:  bottom of page

I think the wording in the last sentence is clumsy. 

 
** Resolved once, may be more
p 26:  Not American spelling, please

Toward the end of the first paragraph, you have used “canceled” instead of “cancelled”. 

 
** Resolved
p 29:  Move a paragraph

I think that the last paragraph in Section 3.4.2 should be moved to be the first paragraph in Section 3.4.3.

 
** Resolved
p 29:  Corollary 3.4.2, not Theorem 3.4.2

In what is currently the second sentence in Section 3.4.3 and in the first sentence of Corollary 3.4.3, the references to Theorem 3.4.2 should both be to Corollary 3.4.2.

pp. 2 & 46: Reference to Thurston’s book

The citation on Google for Three-dimensional geometry and topology  does  indeed show authors Stein, Thurston, and Mather, but this is incorrect.  Stein and Mather are the math series editors for PUP, but the author is Thurston.

Main comments: 

** Resolved?
pg. 4: Your "we do not smooth our corners" comment might scare some readers.  From the look of your next section it sounds like you want to keep everything in the language of stratified spaces, rather than topological manifolds.  So you might want to add some kind of reference to the next section here, i.e. your thesis isn't about topological cobordisms between smooth 3-manifolds.

Pg 6: Typo in paragraph before Example 2.3.3, I think you mean to write $id_M$ ? 

** Resolved
Pg 7: your figure doesn't quite fit in the page.


** Resolved
Pg 10.  Does your terminology $f(\gamma_{i,j,k})$ refer to the set of $\{f(\gamma_i), f(\gamma_j), f(\gamma_k)\}$ ?  I don't see this terminology defined anywhere. What is \gamma_{i,j,k} ? 

** Resolved
pg. 11: Often people don't like it when authors start a sentence with a mathematical symbol.  I do it all the time, but you might be criticized for it. See your last paragraph on this page. "x is the result..."

** Resolved?
pg 12: You say after removing all vertex and edge regions there's only simply-connected regions remaining.   I don't see why this should be true -- why can't you have something like a stratified annulus, or 3-punctured sphere?  If such things never occur it would be good to mention why.  But if they can occur, you should mention that you can avoid those kinds of situations. Perhaps its the particulars of the construction, or there is a way to convert annuli into simply connected regions, etc.  You should say something.  Are you arguing $f(\gamma_i)$ can never be a closed curve, in your situation?  That would do it, if true. But if $M$ really is a closed manifold, these are all closed curves.   So perhaps you mean to say it is avoidable in the cases you will consider. In your case it appears to be related to the specific form of the map you consider -- you are puncturing the 3-manifold.

pg. 13: Paragraph starting with "With all of the regions..." Isn't R_{ (0,i) } contained in R_{ (0,j) } when i=j? 

pg. 14: You use terminology "the singular fiber above the arc is diffeomorphic to either a 2-disc or a pair-of-pants".  I think you should be a little more specific here.  Say you are talking about an edge in your stratification.  Let's say the characteristic map is e : [0,1] --> R^2.   i.e. the image of the function e is "the edge".  There are two objects you can consider: (a) f^{-1}(e([0,1])) or (b) { (t, p) : f(p) = e(t) }.  

(a) is the pre-image of the edge by the function f.  (b) is what you might call the pull-back of the map f along the characteristic map e.  In your classification where you say "the surface is diffeomorphic to..." I believe you really mean case (b), but the way you talk about it, it looks like you are saying (a).  (a) and (b) would be the same if your edge had distinct endpoints, but they are quite different when the edge is a closed loop. 

But I might be confused as to what you mean by "the arcs" on this page.  I suggest either some more precise terminology, or putting in another figure with labels -- or add more detail to Figure 3.3.  Sometimes it appears as if you are referring to arcs that are the same as the 1-skeleton of the stratification of R^2, but other times it looks like you might be referring to the 1-skeleton of the "regions" in Figure 3.3. 

For example, your paragraph "The subsets used to stratify $M$ are... the edges of the vertex and edge regions..." This language can be a bit dizzying -- you are using edge twice and it refers to two different types of edges.  I believe the "edge regions" refer to the regions of Figure 3.3 corresponding to an edge in the stratification of R^2, but then the former usage of "edge" here presumably refers to a decomposition of the boundary of this planar region?   Either a little more terminology to keep this straight or specifics put into the figures to help, could help to keep confusion down.

Generally I like the structure you've given to Section 3. 

pg. 38: "\Gamma is a collection of triangulated disjoint parallel longitudes..." is a little tricky to parse.  From the the way you've written it, it looks like there is no relation between the triangulation of the solid torus T and \Gamma's triangulation. 

Is \partial T a subcomplex of \partial H?  You don't seem to state or imply this.

Algorithm 3: S_{ij} = the triangulated 2-sphere in T_1' bounded by D_i^2 \cup A_{ij} \cup D^2_j.  Don't you mean that S_{ij} is precisely the union D_i^2 \cup A_{ij} \cup D^2_j?   I'm not sure why you have the "bounded by" statement here. 

Small comments.  These are items I don't think you have to change, but they are suggestions of little changes that could help:

Pg 1. The way you write your first paragraph, it sounds almost like a computer-scientist talking about one-way functions and encryption.   The primary audience for your paper will be (1) seasoned 3 and 4-manifold theorists: most likely students of Thurston and Costantino, and then (2) people interested in implementing this algorithm or making variations on it, so those would most likely be researchers in this field and their grad students and of course people like (3) your thesis committee.   For example, I know for a fact that Danny Ruberman will read your thesis and ask one of his students to implement this algorithm, if no one else gets to it ahead of him.  The first paragraph is usually about "situating the topic", i.e. putting it in a context.  My preference is a paragraph like the one below.

For 2-manifolds, "clean answers" and algorithms for basic problems are plentiful. Even rather high-order problems (like computing metrics on Teichmuller space) are practical.  In 3-manifold theory, there is a core of algorithms that cover all of the theory, but they are often quite sophisticated and (historically speaking) unexpected in form. Depending on the specific topic, the algorithms might be hard to implement, or people might prefer pseudo-algorithms like SnapPea as they are conceptually more pleasant.  In high dimensions (5 and up) you hit generalities: many questions are impossible to resolve, these come from complexities of the word problem (fundamental groups), or from the complexities associated to CW-complexes (simple homotopy theory) and smoothing theory.  For 4-manifold theory the landscape for algorithms is un-even and not well understood. Elements of high-dimensions pop up, like the word problem via fundamental group issues, but the corresponding relation to CW-complexes and smoothing theory is completely different.  That said, algorithmic recognition of the 4-sphere is an open problem, where in all other dimensions its resolved.  And then there is this result of Costantino-Thurston, which one  could view as saying "elements of 3-manifold theory persist" into the theory, that basic cobordism questions appear to not need the computationally-difficult ends of 4-manifold theory. i.e. the resolution of this problem given by Thurston and Costantino looks more like traditional 3-manifold theory techniques.

Your 3rd paragraph is bang-on.  Looks great.

Pg. 3, first paragraph: You have two things going on in this paragraph.  You give the set-up that you start your cobordism with M x [0,1] and then you state you will kill one boundary component by attaching handles.  But then you also include details specific to your paper, talking about "prioritizing easy verification", etc.  But the setup of M x [0,1] isn't really part of that, as all cobordisms of M begin this way.  Expositionally, I suggest either confining yourself to M x [0,1] as your start-up data, and if you want to look any further ahead, put in some details.  But saying "prioritizes easy verification... M x [0,1]" is confusing, as all cobordisms start this way.

Those are all my comments for now.  I'll have a closer look at the algorithms later this week.  But my first impressions are good.
