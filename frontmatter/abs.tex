\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}

This thesis presents an algorithm for producing 4--manifold triangulations with boundary an arbitrary orientable, closed, triangulated 3--manifold.
The research is an extension of Costantino and Thurston's work on determining upper bounds on the number of 4--dimensional simplices necessary to construct such a triangulation.
Our first step in this bordism construction is the geometrically partitioning of an initial 3--manifold $M$ using smooth singularity theory.
This partition provides handle attachment sites on the 4--manifold $M \times \Ilit$ and the ensuing handle attachments eliminate one of the boundary components of $M\times \Ilit$, yielding a a 4-manifold with boundary exactly $M$.
We first present the construction in the smooth case before extending the smooth singularity theory to triangulated 3--manifolds.
