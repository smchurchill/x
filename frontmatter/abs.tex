\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}

This thesis presents an algorithm for producing 4--manifold triangulations with boundary an arbitrary orientable, closed, triangulated 3--manifold.
The research is an extension of the work of Costantino and Thurston's work on determining upper bounds on the number of 4--dimensional simplices necessary to construct such a triangulation.
The technique used to construct this bordism applies the 3--manifold technique of constructing a geometric partition of the manifold.
This partition provides handle attachment sites on the 4--manifold $M \times \Ilit$, and handle attachment eliminates one of the boundary components of $M\times \Ilit$, yielding a a 4-manifold with boundary exactly $M$.
We first present the construction in the smooth case before extending the smooth singularity theory used to construct the partition to triangulated 3--manifolds.
