%This project began as an attempt to construct an algorithm turn the process outlined in Chapter 4 of Thurston and Costantino \cite{CostThur08}

The main goal of this document is to provide an algorithm whose input is a closed, orientable 3--manifold triangulation $M$ and whose output is a 4--manifold triangulation whose boundary is $M$.
This algorithm mirrors the constructive proof that a smooth, closed, orientable 3--manifold bounds some 4--manifold presented in Chapter ~\ref{chapter:smooth}.
