Given a smooth, closed 3--manifold $M$, there are infinitely many 4--manifolds with boundary $M$.
For example, consider $M=S^3$.
Removing a 4--ball from any 4--manifold $W$ produces a 4--manifold with $S^3$ boundary.
We therefore do not ensure that the constructed 4--manifold has any properties other than a specified boundary, so our construction prioritizes easy verification that the constructed 4--manifold's boundary is exactly $M$.
This is done by setting $W=M\times \Ilit$, so $W$ has boundary 
\[
	\pd W = (M\times\{0\}) \cup (M\times\{1\}) = M_0 \cup M_1.
\]
We then attach stratified handles to the boundary of $W$ away from $M_0$ until only $M_0$ remains.
