Given a smooth, closed 3--manifold $M$, there are infinitely many 4--manifolds with boundary $M$.
For example, consider $M=S^3$.
Removing a 4--ball from any 4--manifold $W$ produces a 4--manifold with $S^3$ boundary.
Our construction begins with the 4--manifold $W=M\times \Ilit$ which has boundary
\[
\pd W = (M\times\{0\}) \cup (M\times\{1\}) = M_0 \sqcup M_1.
\]
We attach stratified handles to the boundary of $W$ away from $M_0$ until only $M_0$ remains.
Handle attachment sites are obtained through a stratifying procedure in Sections \ref{section:smooth-projection} and \ref{section:smooth-decompose}, but only 2--handle attachment sites are immediate.
The sites for 3--handles appear after considering the effect of 2--handle attachment, and the sites for 4--handles appear after considering the effect of 2-- and 3--handle attachment.
The remainder of this chapter sets the foundation for our analysis of the effect of handle attachments.
