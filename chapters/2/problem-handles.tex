\section{Handles}
\label{section:problem-handles}

The concept of a stratified handle attachment needs some explanation.
First, we define attachment of topological spaces, and use that language to define handle attachment.


\begin{defn}[Attachment]
	Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, $A\subset X$ a subspace, and $f:A\to Y$ a continuous map.
	We define a relation $\sim$ by putting $f(x)\sim x$ for every $x$ in $A$.
	Denote the quotient space $X\sqcup Y/\sim$ by $X\cup_f Y$.
	We call the map $f$ the \emph{attaching map}.  
	We say that $X$ is \emph{attached} or \emph{glued} to $Y$ over $A$.
	A space obtained through attachment is called an \emph{adjunction space} or \emph{attachment space}.
	
	Alternatively, we let $A$ be a topological space and let $i_X:A\to X$, $i_Y:A\to Y$ be inclusions.
	Here, the adjunction is formed by taking $i_X(a)\sim i_Y(a)$ for every $a\in A$ and we denote the adjunction space by $X\cup_A Y$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Handle]
	\label{def:handle}
	Take $n=\lambda+\mu$ and $M$ a smooth $n$--manifold with nonempty boundary $\pd M$.
	Let $D^\lambda$ be the closed $\lambda$--disk and put $H^\lambda = D^\lambda\times D^\mu$.
	Let $\varphi:\pd D^\lambda\times D^\mu\to\pd M$ be an embedding and an attaching map between $M$ and $H^\lambda$.
	The attached space $H^\lambda$ is an \emph{$n$--dimensional $\lambda$--handle}, abbreviated \emph{$(n,\lambda)$--handle}, and $M\cup_\varphi H^\lambda$ is the result of an \emph{$n$--dimensional $\lambda$--handle attachment}, abbreviated \emph{$(n,\lambda)$--handle attachment}.
\end{defn}

Attaching a handle to a manifold can sometimes result in canceling a previously placed handle.
We perform this handle cancellation intentionally in future chapters.
First, we'll define two pieces of anatomy for a handle.

\begin{defn}
	Let $n=\lambda+\mu$, let $H^\lambda=D^\lambda\times D^\mu$ be a $(n,\lambda)$--handle, and let $\varphi:\pd D^\lambda\times D^\mu\to\pd M$ be an attaching map from $H^\lambda$ to the $n$--manifold $M$.
	The sphere $\pd D^\lambda\times \{0\}$ in $H^\lambda$ is the \emph{attaching sphere} of $H^\lambda$, and the sphere $\{0\}\times \pd D^\mu$ is the \emph{belt sphere} of $H^\lambda$.	
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
	Let $M'=(M\cup\varphi H^\lambda)\cup_\psi H^{\lambda+1}$.
	If the attaching sphere of $H^{\lambda + 1}$ intersects the belt sphere of $H^\lambda$ transversely and exactly once, then $M'$ is homeomorphic to $M$.	
\end{prop}

Handle attachment is defined for smooth manifolds, but the resulting attachment space is not a smooth manifold.
Rather, the result is a stratified manifold.
Some other formulations of handle cancellation have a stronger result (specifically, that $M'$ is diffeomorphic to $M$), but this is due to an implied smoothing of the corners resulting from handle attachment.
We keep our corners intact throughout handle attachment, so we introduce the concept of stratified manifolds.
