\section{Handle attachment}

We now investigate the consequences of stratified handle attachment over the face-blocks of the stratified $M_1$ boundary component of $W=M\times\Ilit$.
This investigation is performed by comparing $\pd W$ to $\pd W'$, where
\[
	W' = W\cup\{H_\alpha^2\}_{\alpha\in A} / \sim,
\]
the 4--manifold obtained by attaching stratified 2-handles to $W$.

Attaching these stratified 2--handles to $W$ alters the boundary of $W$ via surgery on $M_1$ that is equivalent to replacing the interiors each face-block with a solid torus whose meridians are longitudes of the replaced face-block.
The annular boundary components of each edge-block are ``filled-in'' by cylinders found between meridians of these newly introduced solid tori, in each case forming a stratified $S^2\times\Ilit$.
These stratified $S^2\times\Ilit$ are taken as attachment neighbourhoods for stratified 3--handles, forming $W''$.

Finally, we compare the boundaries of $W'$ and $W''$ to show that $\pd W''$ is the disjoint union of  $M_0$ with a collection of stratified 3--spheres.
The 3--sphere boundary components are then coned away.
