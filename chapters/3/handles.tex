\section{Handle attachment}

We now investigate the consequences of stratified handle attachment over the face-blocks of the stratified $M_0$ boundary component of $W=M\times\Ilit$.
This investigation is performed by comparing $\pd W$ to $\pd W'$, where
\[
	W' = W\cup\{H_\alpha^2\}_{\alpha\in A} / \sim,
\]
the 4--manifold obtained by attaching stratified 2-handles to $W$.
