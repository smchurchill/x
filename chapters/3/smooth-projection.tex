\section{Projections from 3--manifolds to $\RR$}
\label{section:smooth-projection}

We begin by stating the conditions required of the projection $f:M\to\RR$ for the desired decomposition of $\RR$, hence stratification of $M$, to exist.
For proof that an $f$ satisfying these conditions exists and that such functions are generic, see \cite{Levine65}.
We use the following notation and definitions to describe $f$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $f_\ast$ is the pushforward of $f$.
	
	\item $S_r(f)$ is the set of points in $M$ such that $f_\ast$ has rank $r$.
	
	\item Because $f$ is a smooth map from a closed orientable 3--manifold to an orientable 2--manifold, $S_1$ consists of smooth non-intersecting curves called the \emph{fold curves} of $f$.
	
	\item Let $S_1^c(f)$ be the set of points on $S_1(f)$ at which $f|_{S_1(f)}$ has zero differential.
	Such points appear in the image of $S_1(f)$ as cusps in the plane.
	Then $S_1^c(f)$ is a finite set of points.
\end{enumerate}

The conditions required of $f$ are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $S_0(f)$ is empty.
	\item $S_1^c(f)$ is empty.
	\item If $p\in S_1(f)$
	
\end{enumerate}
