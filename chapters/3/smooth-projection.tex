\section{Projections from 3--manifolds to $\RR$}
\label{section:smooth-projection}

Our stratification of $M$ is induced by a decomposition of the plane, itself induced by the singular values of a smooth map $M\to\RR$.
To prove that a stratification suitable for our construction exists for any smooth orientable 3--manifold, we show first that an inducing decomposition of $\RR$ exists.
To prove that such a decomposition of $\RR$ exists, we present the properties we of $f:M\to\RR$ required to induce the decomposition, and argue why a map possessing such properties exists for any smooth, orientable 3--manifold.

Let $f:M\to\RR$ be a smooth map, let $df$ be the differential of $f$, and let $S_r(f)$ be the set of points in $M$ such that $df$ has rank $r$.
Then we require that the following be true of $f$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $S_0(f)$ is empty.
	
	\item $S_1(f)$ consists of smooth non-intersecting curves.  We call these the \emph{fold curves} of $f$.
	
	\item The set of points where $f|_{S_1(f)}$ has zero differential (these appear as in the image of $S_1(f)$ as cusps in the plane) is empty.
	
	\item If $p\in S_1(f)$ then there exist coordinates $(u, z_1, z_2)$ centred at $p$ and $(x,y)$ centred at $f(p)$ such that $f$ takes the form of either
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item\label{property:paraboloid} $(x,y)=(u,\pm(z_1^2+z_2^2))$, or
		\item\label{property:saddle} $(x,y)=(u,\pm(z_1^2+z_2^2))$
	\end{enumerate}
	in a neighbourhood of $p$.
	If $f$ takes the form of \ref{property:paraboloid} then we further classify $p$ as a \emph{definite fold}, and if $f$ takes the form of \ref{property:saddle} then $p$ is an \emph{indefinite fold}.
	
	\item The set of singular values of $f$ in the plane is connected.
\end{enumerate}

Before proving that an $f$ satisfying these conditions exists, let's explore the implications.
First, a definition.
\begin{defn}
	Because $M$ is closed, $f$ is proper.
	Thus, for any point $q$ in $f(M)$, a fiber of $f$ above $q$ (i.e.\ a connected component of $f\inv(q)$) is either a closed 1--manifold (i.e.\ $S^1$) or contains a critical point of $f$.

	We define a \emph{singular fiber} to be a fiber that contains a critical point of $f$, and a \emph{regular fiber} to be a fiber consisting entirely of regular points.	
\end{defn}


We call these five conditions the \emph{stratification conditions} on $f$.
Let $f:M\to\RR$ be a smooth map possessing properties 1-5.
