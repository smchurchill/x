\section{Projections from 3--manifolds to $\RR$}
\label{section:smooth-projection}

We begin by stating the conditions required of the projection $f:M\to\RR$ for the desired decomposition of $\RR$, hence stratification of $M$, to exist.
For proof that an $f$ satisfying these conditions exists and that such functions are generic, see \cite{Levine65}.
