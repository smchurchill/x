%\section{Attach 3--handles}
%
%The annular boundary components of each edge block are ``filled-in'' by cylinders found between meridians of these newly introduced solid tori, in each case forming a stratified $S^2\times\Ilit$.
%These stratified $S^2\times\Ilit$ are taken as attachment neighbourhoods for stratified 3--handles, forming $W''$.
%
%Finally, we compare the boundaries of $W'$ and $W''$ to show that $\pd W''$ is the disjoint union of  $M_0$ with a collection of stratified 3--spheres.
%The 3--sphere boundary components are then coned away.
