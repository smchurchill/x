\section{Attach 2--handles}

We now investigate the consequences of stratified 2--handle attachment over the face blocks of the stratified $M_1$ boundary component of $W=M\times\Ilit$.
This investigation is performed by comparing $\pd W$ to $\pd W'$, where $W'$ is the 4--manifold obtained by attaching stratified 2-handles to $W$.
Our first step is to precisely define the structure of the stratified 2--handles that we are attaching.

Let $B$ be a face block of $M_1$.
By Theorem \ref{thm:block-structure}, $B$ is a closed solid torus that is stratified-homeomorphic to $S^1\times G_n$, where $G_n$ is an $n$--gon for some $n$.
Consider an unknotted embedding of $B$ in $S^3$, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:face-block-complement}.
The complement of the interior of $B$ is another stratified closed solid torus $B'$, and we extend the stratification of $B'$ by introducing discs that are bounded by the $(1,i)$--indexed strata in $B$, i.e.\ the boundary curves in $B$ corresponding to $S^1\times c_m$ where $c_m$ is a corner of $G_n$, $m=1\dots n$.
Taking $S_B^3$ to be the stratified $S^3$ formed as the union of $B$ and $B'$, we form a stratified 2--handle structure as $C(S_B^3)$, the cone of $S_B^3$.
We call $C(S_B^3)$ the \emph{stratified 2--handle induced by $B$}.

Attaching $C(S_B^3)$ to $W$ over $B\subset M_1$ alters the boundary of $W$ by replacing $B\subset M_1$ with $B'$.
The full extent of this surgery can be detected by examining the edge and vertex blocks of the stratification that are incident to $B$.

\begin{theorem}
	Let $M$ be a smooth, closed, stratified, orientable 3--manifold with stratification induced by a stratifying map $f$, let $\mathfrak{B}$ be the set of face blocks of $M_1$, and let $W=M\times\Ilit$.
	Consider the 4--manifold $W'$ constructed from $W$ as
	\[
		W' = W\cup\{C(S_B^3)\}_{B\in \mathfrak{B}} / \sim,
	\]
	where $\sim$ is defined by $b\sim \iota(b)$, $\iota$ the identity map $C(S_B^3)\supset B\overset{\iota}{\to} B\subset M_1$.
	Then $M_1'=\pd W'\setminus M_0$ is a stratified 3--manifold with a decomposition into \emph{primed edge blocks} and \emph{primed vertex blocks} such that the decomposition is well-defined and the primed blocks have the following structure:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{primed edge block:}
		Let $E'$ be a primed edge block.
		Then $E'$ is identical to an edge block $E$ from Theorem \ref{thm:block-structure} with cylinders (copies of $D^2\times\Ilit$) glued over all annular boundary strata of $E$ (i.e. each closed strata $A$ of $E$ such that $A=E\cap B$ for some face block $B\in\mathfrak{B}$).
		Thus $E'$ is a stratified 3--manifold homeomorphic to $S^2\times\Ilit$
		
		\item \emph{primed vertex block:}
		Let $V$ be a primed vertex block.
		Then $V$ is identical to a vertex block from Theorem \ref{thm:block-structure} with cylinders glued over each annular boundary stratum $A$ of $V$ such that $A=V\cap B$ for some face block $B\in\mathfrak{B}$.
		Thus $V$ is a stratified 3--manifold whose boundary components are each homeomorphic to $S^2$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	We split the proof of this theorem into three parts.
	In the first two parts, we prove that we can find the prescribed primed edge and vertex block structures in $M_1'$.
	In the third part, we show that these structures exhaust $M_1'$.
	
	\textbf{Part 1:}
	Edge blocks occur in three possible forms: regular edge blocks as $A\times\Ilit$, definite edge blocks as $D^2\times\Ilit$, and indefinite edge blocks as $P\times\Ilit$.
	Figure \ref{fig:edge-block-incidence} displays the possible edge block forms and indicates the boundary strata of an edge block that are shared by face blocks.
	Figure \ref{fig:edge-face-shared-boundary} shows the annulus shared by a model edge block $E$ and $B$ in $M_1$ and its corresponding annulus shared by $B$ and $B'$ in $S_B^3$.
	It also demonstrates how the attachment of $C(S_B^3)$ over $B$ introduces a well-defined cylinder from the stratification of $B'$ into $\pd W'$ by gluing it's annular boundary stratum over the annulus $E\cap B$.

	\end{figure}
	
	\textbf{Part 2:}	
	Vertex blocks occur in five possible forms: regular vertex blocks as $S^1$-bundles over the vertex region, indefinite and definite vertex blocks stratified-homeomorphic to those that appear in Figure \ref{fig:codim-1-blocks}, and interactive vertex blocks stratified-homeomorphic to those that appear in Figure \ref{fig:codim-2-blocks}.
	Figure \ref{fig:vertex-block-incidence} displays the possible vertex block forms embedded in $S^3$ and indicates the boundary strata of a vertex block that are shared by face blocks.
	Figure \ref{fig:vertex-face-shared-boundary} shows the annulus shared by a model vertex block $V$ and $B$ in $M_1$ and its corresponding annulus shared by $B$ and $B'$ in $S_B^3$.
	It also demonstrates how the attachment of $C(S_B^3)$ over $B$ introduces a well-defined cylinder from the stratification of $B'$ into $\pd W'$ by gluing it's annular boundary stratum over the annulus $V\cap B$.

	Comparing $\pd W$ to $\pd W'$, we find that for each face block $B$ of $M_1\subset \pd W$, $B$ has been removed and replaced by $B'$, which itself is a stratified closed solid torus whose meridians are longitudes of $B$.
	$B'$ is stratified into a collection of cylinders that alternate 
	
	The result of attaching stratified 2--handles to $W$ over face blocks of $M_1$ is thus a 4--manifold $W'$ whose boundary
