\section{Attach 2--handles}

We now investigate the consequences of stratified 2--handle attachment over the face blocks of the stratified $M_1$ boundary component of $W=M\times\Ilit$.
This investigation is performed by comparing $\pd W$ to $\pd W'$, where
\[
	W' = W\cup\{H_\alpha^2\}_{\alpha\in A} / \sim,
\]
the 4--manifold obtained by attaching stratified 2-handles to $W$.

Attaching these stratified 2--handles to $W$ alters the boundary of $W$ via surgery on $M_1$ that is equivalent to replacing the interiors of each face block with a solid torus whose meridians are longitudes of the replaced face block.
