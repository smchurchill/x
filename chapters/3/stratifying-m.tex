\section{Stratifying $M$}

Stratifying $\RR$ via the singular values of $f$ also induces a stratification of $M$
by considering the fibers of $f$ above the stratifying regions.
The interiors of face regions have preimage through $f$ a disjoint collection of face blocks, the interiors of edge regions have preimage of edge blocks, and of vertex regions, vertex blocks.

To understand the structure of face, edge, and vertex blocks we investigate the preimages of regular and singular values of $f$ in the plane.
\begin{defn}
	Because $M$ is closed, $f$ is proper.
	Thus, for any point $q$ in $f(M)$, a fiber of $f$ above $q$ (i.e.\ a connected component of $f\inv(q)$) is either a closed 1--manifold (i.e.\ $S^1$) or contains a critical point of $f$.
	
	We define a \emph{singular fiber} to be a fiber that contains a critical point of $f$, and a \emph{regular fiber} to be a fiber consisting entirely of regular points.	
\end{defn}

The subsets used to stratify $M$ are the fibers of $f$ that lie above the individual strata of our $\RR$ stratification.
Because the $(0,\cdot)$--strata are regular values, their fibers are regular, hence a finite collection of disjointly embedded circles in $M$.
We take these circles as the first collection of subsets that filter $M$, and assign to them the indices $(1,i)$ for $i = 1,\dots, N_1$, where $N_1$ is the number of circles.
These circles are disjoint, so $(1,i)\nleq (1,j)$ for any $i,j$.

The $(1,\cdot)$--strata of the $\RR$ stratification connect the $(0,\cdot)$--strata of the $\RR$ stratification and either consist entirely of regular values or contain exactly one singular value.
As pictured in Figure \ref{fig:face-sleeve}, a $(1,\cdot)$--strata contains exactly one singular value precisely when it is the shared boundary of a vertex region and an edge region.
When a $(1,\cdot)$--strata contains exactly one singular value, exactly one fiber above that value is a singular fiber, with the rest regular fibers.
A $(1,\cdot)$--strata is diffeomorphic to the unit interval and $f$ is a smooth submersion between smooth manifolds, so a fiber above a $(1,\cdot)$--strata is a surface whose boundary circles are the fibers above the strata's endpoints.
When the fiber is regular, the surface is diffeomorphic to an annulus $S^1\times\Ilit$.
When the fiber is singular, the surface classification depends on the type of singularity.
Theorem \ref{thm:saeki} and Figure \ref{fig:saeki-fibers} show that the fiber containing the singularity either has the structure of a figure-of-eight (when the singularity is part of an indefinite fold) or is a single point (when the singularity is part of a definite fold), hence the singular fiber above the arc is diffeomorphic to either a 2--disk or a pair-of-pants.

Theorem \ref{thm:saeki} refers to a \emph{stable map}, and we'll denote the set of smooth stable maps $X\to Y$ by $Stab(X,Y)$.
When $X$ is a smooth, closed, orientable 3--manifold and $Y$ is the plane, $Stab(X,Y)$ consists of all maps $X\to Y$ satisfying the first five stratification conditions.
The last stratification condition is trivially satisfied because $X$ is closed, hence the set of stratifying maps $X\to Y$ is the subset of $Stab(X,Y)$ consisting of maps $f$ such that $f(S(f))$ is connected.

\begin{theorem}[Adapted Theorem 3.15 in Saeki \cite{Saeki}]
	\label{thm:saeki}
	Let $f:M\to N$ be a proper $C^\infty$ stable map of an orientable 3--manifold $M$ into a surface $N$.
	Then, every singular fiber of $f$ is equivalent to the disjoint union of:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item one of the fibers in Figure \ref{fig:saeki-fibers}, and
		\item the disjoint union of a finite number of copies of $S^1$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Furthermore, no two fibers in the list are equivalent to each other even after taking the union with regular circle components.		
\end{theorem}

	}
	\label{fig:saeki-fibers}	
\end{figure}

The surface fibers above the $(1,\cdot)$--strata are the second collection of subsets that filter $M$, and they are assigned the indices $(2,j)$ for $j=1,\dots, N_2$, where $N_2$ is the number of surfaces.
The boundary circles of the surfaces are each subsets of the filtration, indexed by the $(1,i)$ indices, so $(1,i)\leq (2,j)$ if and only if $M_{(1,i)}$ is one of the boundary components of $M_{(2,j)}$.
These surfaces intersect one another only when they share a boundary circle, so $(2,j)\nleq (2,k)$ for any $j,k$.

There are three types of region in the decomposition: face, edge, and vertex.
Regardless of the type of region, they are indexed in our filtration similarly to the edges.
A fiber above a region is a 3--manifold with corners formed by the $(1,i)$- and $(2,j)$-level strata, and fibers are disjoint away from their boundaries.
We therefore index fibers above regions with the indices $(3,k)$ for $k=1,\dots, N_3$ where $N_3$ is the total number of fibers above regions, put $(n,i)\leq (3,k)$ if and only if $M_{(n,i)}$ is contained in the boundary of $M_{(3,k)}$.

Recall that we call a closed 3--dimensional stratum of $M$ a \emph{block}.
At the beginning of this chapter we laid out the structure of the blocks that we expect to find inside of $M$ and, with stratification complete, we are now able to investigate these structures and determine how they are formed.
Blocks are categorized by the $\RR$-stratification regions they project to: as face, edge, or vertex blocks.
This classification determines the possible singularities that we can find inside of a block.
We first restate the definitions of the various blocks and include partial justifications based on the singularities of $M$.
In Theorem \ref{thm:block-structure} we prove that the stratification conditions impose this structure on the blocks of $M$.

{\renewcommand\labelitemi{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Face block:}
		Let $B$ be a face block that fibers over the face region $F$.
		Then $B$ is stratified--homeomorphic to $S^1\times F$.
		
		\item \textbf{Edge block:}
		Let $B$ be an edge block that fibers over the edge region $E$.
		Let $A$ be the annulus $S^1\times\Ilit$ and $P$ the pair-of pants surface (i.e.\ $D^2$ minus a pair of disjoint open balls).
		If $B$ is a regular fiber over $E$ then $B$ is stratified--homeomorphic to $S^1\times E$, hence also stratified--homeomorphic to $A\times\Ilit$.
		Otherwise, $B$ is a singular fiber over $E$ and contains part of a definite or indefinite fold.
		In this case we call $B$ a \emph{definite} or \emph{indefinite edge block}.
		A definite edge block is stratified--homeomorphic to $D^2\times\Ilit$ and an indefinite edge block is stratified--homeomorphic to $P\times\Ilit$.
		
		\item \textbf{Vertex block:}
		Let $B$ be a vertex block that fibers over the vertex region $V$.
		If $B$ is a regular fiber then it is homeomorphic to $S^1\times V$, therefore homeomorphic to a (3,1)--handlebody of genus 1.
		Otherwise, we see from Figure \ref{fig:saeki-fibers} that the singular fiber above the codimension 2 singularity contained in $V$ is either connected or disconnected.
		If the singular fiber is disconnected then there is a pair of disjoint vertex blocks that each contain one of the singular fibers, hence part of a definite or indefinite fold.
		We therefore classify these blocks as \emph{definite} or \emph{indefinite vertex blocks}.
		If the singular fiber is connected, then the block containing it is an \emph{interactive vertex block}.
		A definite (resp.\ indefinite) vertex block extends and connects definite (resp.\ indefinite) edge blocks, and is homeomorphic to a (3,1)--handlebody of genus 0 (resp.\ 2).
		An interactive vertex block is homeomorphic to a (3,1)--handlebody of genus 3.
	\end{itemize}
}

\begin{rmk}
	The structures of the blocks
	%	 described in Theorem \ref{thm:block-structure}
	are roughly disk bundles over a representative fiber for the given region or, equivalently, regular neighbourhoods of that fiber.
	For a block that is a regular fiber, the representative is a circle.
	For a definite or indefinite block, the representative is the singular fiber containing a definite or indefinite fold, and for an interactive block the representative fiber is the singular fiber above the codimension 2 singular value.
\end{rmk}


\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:block-structure}
	Let $M$ be a smooth, closed, orientable 3--manifold, let $f:M\to\RR$ be a stratifying map, suppose $\RR$ has been decomposed as in Section \ref{section:smooth-decompose} and $M$ has been stratified as in this section.
	Let $B$ be a block of $M$.
	Then $B$ is a face, edge, or vertex block if $f(B)$ is a face, edge, or vertex region respectively.
	
%	, and a block has one of the following structures:

\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:block-structure}]
	We split the proof into three parts.
	The first part proves that if a block $B$ is a regular fiber over the region $R$ then $B$ is stratified--homeomorphic to $S^1\times R$.
	In the second part, we prove that definite and indefinite blocks are stratified--homeomorphic to $D^2\times\Ilit$ or to $P\times\Ilit$ respectively.
	In the final part we discuss interactive vertex blocks, and show that they are homeomorphic to (3,1)--handlebodies of genus 3.
	Figures \ref{fig:codim-1-surfaces}-\ref{fig:vertex-block-incidence} illustrate block structures.
	
	\textbf{Part 1:}
	Let $B$ be a block over the region $R$, and suppose $B$ consists entirely of regular fibers over $R$.
	Then $(B, R, f|_B, S^1)$ has the structure of a circle bundle over $R$.
	A fiber bundle over a contractible space is trivial, so $B$ is homeomorphic to $S^1 \times R$.
	Furthermore, this homeomorphism is stratified by ensuring the strata of $B$ are mapped to the strata of $S^1 \times R$, where the stratification of $S^1 \times R$ is defined by the manifold with corners structure induced by the product topology.

	\end{figure}



	\textbf{Part 2:}
	Let $B$ be a definite or indefinite block over the region $R$.
	$R$ is a subset of the plane homeomorphic to $D^2$ with an arc $\gamma_s \subset X_f$ of singular values running from one of its edges to another.
	Let $\gamma_t$ be a second simple arc that crosses $\gamma_s$ transversely, and consider the cross-sectional surface obtained by $f\inv(\gamma_t)$.
	Figure \ref{fig:codim-1-surfaces} illustrates the possible surfaces containing the singular fiber over $x=\gamma_s\cap\gamma_t$.
		



	This cross section is general, so we fit a tubular neighbourhood $\nu(\gamma_s)$ about $\gamma_s$ in $R$ to obtain a bundle structure for $f\inv(\nu(\gamma_s))$ whose fiber is one of the cross-sectional surfaces (a disk or a pair-of-pants) and whose base is the arc $\gamma_s$, i.e. an interval.
	The interval is contractible, so $f\inv(\nu(\gamma_s))$ is homeomorphic to $\Sigma\times\Ilit$ for $\Sigma$ a disk or a pair-of-pants surface.
	Away from $\nu(\gamma_s)$, $R$ consists entirely of regular values so we obtain solid tori (cf. Part 1) that extend the $\Sigma\times\Ilit$ structure as seen in Figure \ref{fig:codim-1-blocks}.

	As with Part 1, the homeomorphism described is stratified by ensuring the strata of $B$ are mapped to the strata of $\Sigma \times \Ilit$, where the stratification of $\Sigma \times \Ilit$ is defined by the manifold with corners structure induced by the product topology.
	
	\textbf{Part 3:}	
	Let $B$ be an interactive block over the region $R$.
	Interactive blocks occur over octagonal vertex regions where the singular fiber above the region's codimension 2 singularity is connected, so we investigate these fibers.
	The codimension 2 singular value lies at the intersection of a pair of arcs of codimension 1 singular values.
	Call the arcs $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$, let $x = \gamma_1\cap \gamma_2$, and denote the interactive singular fiber over $x$ by $B_x = B\cap f\inv(x) = \{b\in B\:|\:f(b)=x\}$.
	Our method of investigation begins by examining the possible resolutions of $B_x$ and combining those resolutions to form a genus 3 surface.
	 
	Figure \ref{fig:codim-2-interactive-fiber-1} demonstrates resolutions of the singular points of $B_x$ when $B_x$ has the first interactive singular fiber form presented in Figure \ref{fig:saeki-fibers}.
	We first note that all of the displayed fibers have inherited an orientation from $M$.
	This forces fiber resolution to be unambiguous, and allows us to identify fibers when forming the surface shown in Figure \ref{fig:codim-2-surface-1}.

	\label{fig:codim-2-surface-1}
	\end{figure}

	We form the surface shown in Figure \ref{fig:codim-2-surface-1} by gluing together surfaces that project over simple arcs transversing the codimension 1 singular values.
	Gluing is performed over the boundary circles of these surfaces, and is prescribed by the resolutions in Figure \ref{fig:codim-2-interactive-fiber-1}.
	The transverse preimage containing the left column of fibers in Figure \ref{fig:codim-2-interactive-fiber-1} is a pair of pants with two green `cuffs' (top left) and a blue `waist' (bottom left).
	The preimage containing the top row is a pair of pants with two green cuffs (top left) and a pink waist (top right).
	The first gluing that helps realize the surface in Figure \ref{fig:codim-2-surface-1} is of the `left' transverse preimage surface with the `top' transverse preimage surface over their shared green cuffs.
	The surfaces recovered as transversal preimages are then:
	
%	The bottom row and left column each also produce single pairs of pants, and we continue the gluing: purple cuffs to purple cuffs from right to bottom, blue waist to blue waist from bottom to left, then green cuffs to green cuffs from left to top.
%	Figure \ref{fig:codim-2-surface-1} depicts the result of this gluing.

		\item \textbf{Left:} a pair of pants with blue waist and green cuffs

		\item \textbf{Bottom:} a pair of pants with blue waist and purple cuffs
	\end{itemize}
	}

	
	The surface $\Sigma$ in Figure \ref{fig:codim-2-surface-1} is the boundary of $H(B_x)$, a regular neighbourhood of $B_x$ in $M$, i.e. a genus-3 (3,1)--handlebody inside of $M$.
	$H(B_x)$ projects through $f$ over $\bar\nu(x)$, a closed tubular neighbourhood of $x$, and $\Sigma$ projects over $\pd(\bar\nu(x))$.
	
	Figure \ref{fig:codim-2-surface-1} presents $\Sigma$ and $B_x$ as objects embedded in $S^3$, where $\Sigma$ bounds genus-3 (3-1)--handlebodies on both sides.
	We take the `inside' component of $S^3\setminus\Sigma$ (i.e. the component containing $B_x$) to be $H(B_x)$.
	
	Outside of $\bar\nu(x)$ we use the investigations from Parts 1 and 2 of this proof. The rest of $R$, $f\inv(R\setminus\bar\nu(x))$, has the structure of a $\Sigma$-bundle over the interval, and the bundle extends $H(B_x)$ to the boundary of $R$, preserving the structure as a genus-3 (3,1)--handlebody.
	We conclude that $B$ is homeomorphic to a genus-3 (3,1)--handlebody.

	An identical argument is made when $B_x$ has the second interactive singular fiber form, using Figures \ref{fig:codim-2-interactive-fiber-2} and \ref{fig:codim-2-surface-2} in place of Figures \ref{fig:codim-2-interactive-fiber-1} and \ref{fig:codim-2-surface-1} respectively.

\end{proof}

A smooth map $f$ satisfying the stratification conditions of Section \ref{section:smooth-projection} induces a decomposition on $\RR$ and a stratification of $M$.
It is important to note here that the restrictions on $f$ can induce a wide variety of possible stratifications of $M$, highlighting the variability of the resulting 4--manifold.
We end this section with a lemma that guarantees the stratified 2--handle attachments of the next section can be made over our face blocks in any order, hence we can assume all attachments occur simultaneously.


\begin{lem}
	Let $M$ be a 3--manifold with stratification induced as in Theorem \ref{thm:block-structure}.
	Then blocks of the same type (i.e. face, edge, vertex) are disjoint.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
	The fibers above a given region are disjoint, so the blocks above that region are disjoint.
	Regions of the same type are disjoint, hence blocks that are fibers above differing regions are also disjoint.
\end{proof}
