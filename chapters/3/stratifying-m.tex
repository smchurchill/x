\section{Stratifying $M$}

Decomposing $\RR$ via the singular values of $f$ also induces a stratification of $M$ by considering the preimage through $f$ of the decomposing regions.
The interiors of a face-regions have preimage through $f$ a disjoint collection of face-blocks, the interiors of edge-regions have preimage of edge-blocks, and of vertex-regions, vertex-blocks.
