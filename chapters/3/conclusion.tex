\section{Conclusion}

This chapter presents a proof that smooth, closed, orientable 3--manifolds bound 4--manifolds by providing a method of construction.
The resulting 4--manifold is not smooth, but it is stratified and the stratification is well-defined.
Moreover, the 4--manifold depends heavily on the map $f:M\to\RR$, and no investigation is made into any relationship between 4-manifolds produced by $f,g:M\to\RR$ as would be explained by a relationship between $f$ and $g$.
