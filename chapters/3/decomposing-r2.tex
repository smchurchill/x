\section{Decomposing $\RR$}

We use a projection $f$ satisfying the conditions in Section \ref{section:smooth-projection} to induce a particular decomposition on $\RR$.
We fit closed neighbourhoods around the singular values of $f$ and classify these sleeves by the maximum codimension (with respect to $\RR$) of singular values they contain.
Because $S_f$, the singular values of $f$, consists of codimension 1 and codimension 2 singular values (i.e.\ arcs and arc-crossings respectively), we decompose $\RR$ into face-regions that contain no singular values, edge-regions that contain only codimension 1 singular values, and vertex-regions, each of which contain exactly 1 codimension 2 singular value.
