\section{Decomposing $\RR$}

Let $f:M\to\RR$ be a smooth map possessing the stratification conditions of Section \ref{section:smooth-projection} and let $X_f = f(S(f))$, the set of singular values of $f$.
Then $X_f$ is a connected collection of arcs in the plane that intersect only transversely.

We fit closed neighbourhoods around the singular values of $f$ and classify these sleeves by the maximum codimension (with respect to $\RR$) of singular values they contain.
Because $X_f$ consists of codimension 1 and codimension 2 singular values (i.e.\ arcs and arc-crossings respectively), we decompose $\RR$ into face-regions that contain no singular values, edge-regions that contain only codimension 1 singular values, and vertex-regions, each of which contain exactly 1 codimension 2 singular value.
