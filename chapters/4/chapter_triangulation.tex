\chapter{Algorithm for triangulated manifolds}
\label{chapter:triangulation}

Algorithmic construction of a triangulated 4--manifold with prescribed closed, orientable 3--manifold boundary broadly follows the steps we used in the construction of a 4--manifold a with prescribed smooth, orientable 3--manifold boundary.
Let $N$ be a closed, orientable 3--manifold triangulation.
Then the steps of construction are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define a projection $f:N\to\RR$.
	
	\item Induce a subdivision of $N$ from $f$.  The result is a 3--dimensional polyhedral gluing $N'$ that is equivalent to $N$.
	
	\item Subdivide $N'$ into a 3--manifold triangulation $M$ that is equivalent to $N$.
	
	\item Form the 4--manifold triangulation $W=M\times\Ilit$ with boundary components $M_0 = M\times\{0\}$ and $M_1 = M\times\{1\}$.  This is done by gluing a 4--prism to each tetrahedron of $M$.
	
	\item Attach 4--dimensional 2--handles to $W$ over its $M_1$ boundary as prescribed by the subdivision of $M$ from $f$.  Call the result $W'$ and let $M_1'=\pd W' \setminus M_0$.
	
	\item Form $W''$ by attaching 4--dimensional 3--handles to $W'$ over $M_1'$ as prescribed by the subdivision induced by $f$ and the surgery induced by 2--handle attachment.
	
	\item The boundary of $W''$ consists of $M_0$ and a collection of copies of $S^3$. Attaching a 4--handle to each $S^3$ boundary component results in a triangulated 4--manifold whose boundary is exactly $M_0$.
\end{enumerate}

%Each of these steps is made algorithmic, and these algorithms are chained in series to form a single algorithm.
This construction has input a closed, orientable 3--manifold triangulation $N$ and output a 4--manifold triangulation $W'''$ whose sole boundary component is a triangulated 3--manifold that is equivalent to $N$.
In this case, we find that $\pd W'''$ is a subdivision of $N$, and this subdivision is the subdivision induced by the projection $f$ in Step 1.

It is necessary that the input 3--manifold triangulation is \emph{edge-distinct}, i.e.\ if $u,v$ are vertices of $N$ then $\{u,v\}$ is the boundary of at most one edge.
If this condition is not satisfied by a given $N$, then it is satisfied by the barycentric subdivision of $N$.
We assume that $N$ is edge-distinct for the remainder of the chapter.

Throughout this chapter $N$ refers to the input closed, orientable 3--manifold triangulation, $f$ refers to the subdividing map defined in Section \ref{section:pl-projection}, $M$ is the subdivision of $N$ induced by $f$, $W$ is the 4--manifold triangulation obtained from $M\times\Ilit$, $W'$ is the result of attaching 2--handles to $W$, and $W''$ is the result of attaching 3--handles to $W'$.
