\startchapter{Algorithm for constructing a triangulated 4--manifold with prescribed 3--manifold boundary}
\label{chapter:triangulation}

The steps to construct a triangulated 4--manifold with prescribed 3--manifold boundary broadly follow the steps to construct a 4--manifold with prescribed smooth, orientable 3--manifold boundary.
Let $N$ be a 3--manifold triangulation.
Then the steps of construction are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[Step 1:] Define a projection $f:N\to\RR$.
	
	\item[Step 2:] Induce a subdivision of $N$ from $f$.  The result is a 3--manifold triangulation $M$ that is equivalent to $N$ in the sense of triangulations.

	\item[Step 3:] Let $W=M\times\Ilit$ be a 4--manifold with boundary components $M_0 = M\times\{0\}$ and $M_1 = M\times\{1\}$.
	
	\item[Step 4:] Attach 4--dimensional 2--handles to $W$ over its $M_0$ boundary as prescribed by the subdivision of $M$ from $f$.  Call the result $W'$ and call the boundary of $W'$ different from $M_1$ by $M_0'$.
	
	\item[Step 5:] Attach 4--dimensional 3--handles to $W'$ over $M_0'$ as prescribed by the subdivision induced by $f$ and the surgery induced by 2--handle attachment.  Call the result $W''$.
	
	\item[Step 6:] The boundary of $W''$ consists of $M_1$ and a collection of copies of $S^3$ that we now cone off.  The result is a 4--manifold whose boundary is exactly $M_1$.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these steps is made algorithmic, and these algorithms are chained in series to form a single algorithm.
The result has input a closed, orientable 3--manifold triangulation $M$ and output a 4--manifold triangulation $W$ whose sole boundary component is a triangulated 3--manifold that is equivalent to $M$ in the sense of triangulations.
In this case, we find that $\pd W$ is a subdivision of $M$, and this subdivision is the subdivision induced by the projection $f$ in Step 1.

Throughout this chapter $N$ refers to the initial input 3--manifold triangulation, $f$ to the projection defined in Section ~\ref{section:pl-projection}, $M$ is the subdivision of $N$ induced by $f$, $W$ is the 4--manifold $M\times\Ilit$, $W'$ is the result of attaching 2--handles to $W$, and $W''$ is the result of attaching 3--handles to $W'$.
