\section{Define projection}

The projection's utility is in defining a subdivision of the initial closed, orientable 3--manifold triangulation $N$ such that attaching regions for triangulated 2-- and 3--handles can be found.
This is done before forming the base 4--manifold so that the subdivided triangulation is used in the base.
