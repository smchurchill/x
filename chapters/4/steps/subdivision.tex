\section{Induce subdivision}

The goal of subdividing $N$ is to create and identify analogues to the face, edge, and vertex blocks of Chapter \ref{chapter:smooth} where we may iteratively attach 2--, 3--, then 4-- handles.
We use a similar technique to that found in Chapter \ref{chapter:smooth}, iteratively subdividing the tetrahedra of $N$.
Tetrahedron subdivisions are compatible, i.e.\ tetrahedron subdivisions fit together exactly as the undivided tetrahedra do inside of $N$.

Let $\sigma$ be a tetrahedron of $N$.
If $e$ is an edge of $N^1\setminus\sigma^1$ such that $f(e)\cap f(\sigma)$ is nonempty, then $f(e)\cap f(\sigma)$ is a line segment in $f(\sigma)$ away from any vertices or crossings of $f(\sigma)$.
The possible configurations of these line segments are demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:standard-position-intersection}.
The preimages of these line segments inside of $\sigma$ are triangles and quads as seen in Figure \ref{fig:standard-position-intersection}.
When a pair of these preimages intersect, the intersection is a line segment with endpoints interior to a pair of triangles of $\sigma^2$.

Decomposition of $\RR$ is done through $f(N_1)$.
A point in $f(N_1)$ is the image of either a vertex, exactly one edge, or exactly two edges (i.e.\ is an edge crossing), so we refer to these as the \emph{vertices}, \emph{edges}, and \emph{crossings} of the decomposition.
Because $f(N)\setminus f(N_1)$  is a disjoint collection of simply connected regions, we call the connected components of $f(N)\setminus f(N_1)$ the \emph{faces} of the decomposition.

We construct our subdivision of $N$ using the decomposition component preimages.
The preimage of a face component defines substructures analogous to face blocks, of edge components to edge blocks, and vertices and crossings to vertex blocks.
Inside of an individual tetrahedron of $N$, edge and crossing preimages are well-defined, supplying a natural subdivision of $N$ into a cell complex.
Then, the subdivision of a cell complex into a triangulation is well-defined.

The algorithm presented in this section takes as input a closed, orientable 3--manifold triangulation $N$ and a projection $f:N\to\RR$ and produces as output a closed, orientable 3--dimensional cell complex $M$ that is a subdivision of $N$.
Furthermore, the 3--cells of $M$ are partitioned into subsets that serve the same purpose as the face blocks of Chapter \ref{chapter:smooth}: attaching regions for 2--handles.
This 3--cell partitioning also induces a partition on the 2--cells of $M$ into subsets that are either interior to face blocks, or subsets that serve the same purpose as the edge blocks of Chapter ~\ref{chapter:smooth}, i.e.\ buffers between face blocks.
