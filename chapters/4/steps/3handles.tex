\section{Attach 3--handles}

We now have a triangulated 4--manifold with boundary components $M_0$ and the result of surgery on $M_1$ induced by 2--handle attachment.
This surgery had the following effect on $M_1$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each solid torus in the partition of $M_1$ induced by the projection from Section ~\ref{section:pl-projection} is associated with a triangulated $D^4$ in Section ~\ref{section:pl-2-handle}.
	\item For each (torus, 2--handle) pair $(T, H^2)$, the boundary of $H^2$ contains $T$ and $T^* = H^2\setminus \interior{T}$ is another solid torus whose boundary triangulation is identical to that of $T$.
	\item Thus the effect of surgery on $M_1$ is of replacing each $T$ with $T^*$ over their shared boundary.
\end{enumerate}
