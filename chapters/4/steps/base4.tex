\section{Form base 4--manifold}

The algorithm presented in this chapter takes as input a closed, orientable 3--manifold triangulation $M$ and produces as output a 4--manifold triangulation $W$ whose boundary is the disjoint union of two copies of $M$.
We do this by explicitly triangulating the cell complex $W\times\Ilit$.
