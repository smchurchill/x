\section{Attach Handles}
\label{section:pl-handle}

At this point in the chapter we have constructed a 4--manifold triangulation $W$ with two boundary components, each equivalent to the 3--dimensional cell complex $M$ obtained in Section \ref{section:pl-subdivide}.
Furthermore, the cells of $M$ are partitioned into subcomplexes analogous to the face, edge, and vertex blocks of Chapter \ref{chapter:smooth}.
Explicit attachment sites are available for 2--handles, so our first step is construction of a 2--handle.

\subsection{Attach 2--handles}
\label{section:pl-2-handle}

The algorithm of this subsection takes as input a pair $(T,\Gamma)$ where $T$ is a closed solid torus triangulation and $\Gamma$ is a collection of triangulated parallel longitudes in the boundary of $T$.
The output is a 4--disk triangulation $H$ satisfying the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\pd H$ is a triangulated $S^3$ with a genus 1 Heegard splitting over $\pd T$, i.e.\ $\pd H\setminus \overset{\circ}{T}$ is a solid torus.
	\item For each $\gamma_i$ in $\Gamma$, $\gamma_i$ bounds a triangulated disk in $\pd H$, i.e.\ each $\gamma_i$ is an explicit 0-framing for the 2--handle attachment.
\end{enumerate}
We take $H$ to be a 4--dimensional 2--handle and attach $H$ to $W$ over $T$.

To produce pairs $(T,\Gamma)$ we first consider $M$, the subdivision of $N$ induced by the subdividing map $f:N\to\RR$.
Let $B$ be a face block analogue of $M$.
$B$ is a 3--dimensional subcomplex of $M$ whose interior $\interior{B}$ projects over a connected component of $\RR\setminus f(N_1)$.
%, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:regular-pl-blocks}.
Furthermore, $f(B)$ is an $n$--gon for some $n$ whose boundary is inside of $f(N_1)$.


%$B$ possesses the structure of a 3--disk if and only if for some edge $e$ of $B$
%The preimages of the corners of $f(B)$ are parallel longitudes of $B$, and we form a triangulated 2--handle containing $B$ by demanding that these longitudes each bound disks in the 2--handle.

\subsection{Attach 3--handles}

We now have a triangulated 4--manifold with boundary components $M_0$ and the result of surgery on $M_1$ induced by 2--handle attachment.
This surgery had the following effect on $M_1$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each solid torus in the partition of $M_1$ induced by the projection from Section ~\ref{section:pl-projection} is associated with a triangulated $D^4$ in Section ~\ref{section:pl-2-handle}.
	\item For each (torus, 2--handle) pair $(T, H^2)$, the boundary of $H^2$ contains $T$ and $T^* = H^2\setminus \interior{T}$ is another solid torus whose boundary triangulation is identical to that of $T$.
	\item Thus the effect of surgery on $M_1$ is of replacing each $T$ with $T^*$ over their shared boundary.
\end{enumerate}
