\section{Attach 2--handles}

At this point in our procedure we have a 4--manifold $W$ with triangulated boundary components $M_0$ and $M_1$.
We aim to attach handles to $W$ over the boundary of $W$ away from $M_1$ until the boundary of $W$ is exactly $M_1$.
The first step is to attach 2--handles to $W$ over the closed solid torus triangulations that partition $M_0$.

The algorithm of this section takes as input a closed solid torus triangulation $T$ with a triangulated curve $\gamma$ in its boundary ($\gamma$ is an explicit 0-framing for the 2--handle attachment) and produces as output a $D^4$ triangulation whose $S^3$ boundary triangulation has genus 1 Heegard splitting over $\pd T$, and $\gamma$ bounds a disk in $\pd D^4\setminus T$.
Such a $D^4$ triangulation is taken as a 4--dimensional 2--handle and attached to $W$ over $T$.
We then attach such a 2--handle over each closed solid torus in our partition of $M_0$.
