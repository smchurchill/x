\section{Attach 2--handles}
\label{section:pl-2-handle}

At this point in our procedure we have a 4--manifold $W$ with triangulated boundary components $M_0$ and $M_1$.
We aim to attach handles to $W$ over the boundary of $W$ away from $M_0$ until the boundary of $W$ is exactly $M_0$.
The first step is to attach 2--handles to $W$ over the closed solid torus triangulations that partition $M_1$.

The algorithm of this section takes as input a closed solid torus triangulation $T$ with a collection of triangulated parallel longitudes $\Gamma$ in its boundary (each $\gamma_i$ in $\Gamma$ is an explicit 0-framing for the 2--handle attachment) and produces as output a $D^4$ triangulation whose $S^3$ boundary triangulation has genus 1 Heegard splitting over $\pd T$, and $\gamma_i$ bounds a triangulated disk in $\pd D^4\setminus T$ for each $i$.
Such a $D^4$ triangulation is taken as a 4--dimensional 2--handle and attached to $W$ over $T$.
We then attach such a 2--handle over each closed solid torus in our partition of $M_0$.
